                <h3>We have had some time to reset and reflect. It is time to reconnect.</h3>
                <p>
                    In the year 2020, the world, as we know it, was taken from us too quickly and unexpectedly.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    Without a doubt, the year has been a challenging period and affected many of us greatly; commercially, mentally, physically, and spiritually.
                    If there's any silver lining to this pandemic, it's our newfound gratitude towards nature.
                </p> <br />

                <p>
                    The appreciation especially strikes a chord with urban-city dwellers. <br />
                    Activities such as strolling on a beach, trekking in scenic mountains, cycling through rice paddies, have become life's recent luxury.<br />
                </p> <br />

                <p>
                    In recent months, Regency has stepped up notably its measure to keep guests and colleagues safe, while at the same time, the luxury resort has designed invigorating healing activities to promote mental and physical wellbeing.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    Regency believes that the healing process starts with a good night's sleep. Therefore, we create a Regency Sleeping Experience which assists the guests to enhance their sleep quality with attention to details such as room temperature, scent, lighting, and sounds.
                </p> <br />
                <p>
                    Start your day with a shot of Jamu Jahe and tuck into Samsara Eggs and Lobster - it's your holiday and you can eat whatever tickles your fancy. Feasting within the lush setting of The Regency is nourishing for both the body and soul.
                    <br />Then, spare a few minutes and try Regency's 'Meditation for Medication' to practise mindfulness. To get sweaty and pump endorphins into your body, 'Sports Culture' is ideal. Guests are free to choose any treatments they want at the end of the day, everyone heals differently.
                </p> <br />

                <p>
                    To wrap the day, unwind and embrace the tranquil sound of surrounding nature with a swim under the stars in Regency's heated pool while the staff prepares your room for the ultimate sleeping experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, we understand that healing does not happen instantly, but occurs gradually. We hope you are elated by the mental and physical lightness after a holiday with Regency. In addition, each purchase of the 'Healing at Your Leisure' package helps nearby families as some proceeds are used to donate food to nearby families.
                </p> <br />
